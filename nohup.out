Building App Bundle Locally

You are attempting to run Meteor as the "root" user. If you are developing,
this is almost certainly *not* what you want to do and will likely result in
incorrect file permissions. However, if you are running this in a build process
(CI, etc.) or you are absolutely sure you know what you are doing, add the
`--unsafe-perm` flag to this command to proceed.


=> Build Error. Check the logs printed above.
